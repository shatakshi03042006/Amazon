A responsive Amazon homepage clone built using HTML5 and CSS3.

This project recreates the layout of Amazon’s landing page, including the navbar, search bar, product sections, banners, and footer. Media queries are used to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes, along with Flexbox and Grid for proper layout structuring.
